Inspired by guides from [here](https://github.com/ahkarami/Deep-Learning-in-Production#deploy-tensorflow-models-in-production)

- [Flask RESTPlus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for simple creation of REST API's with Flask

### Future plans
- 2-component API using protobufs/TF Serving and a public REST API. You cannot issue requests to TF Server using 
REST (rather gRPC), why you need a second component. [Link](https://becominghuman.ai/creating-restful-api-to-tensorflow-models-c5c57b692c10)
